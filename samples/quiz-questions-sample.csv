"Q1. What is the value of $$\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \, dx$$?","$\frac{1}{2}$","$\frac{1}{3}$","$\frac{2}{3}$","$1$","B","Using power rule: $$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}.$$"
"Q2. Find the roots of $$x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.$$","$x = 2, 3$","$x = -2, -3$","$x = 1, 6$","$x = 3, 5$","A","Factorization: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3)$ so $x=2,3$."
"Q3. Simplify: $$(2x^2 - 3x + 1) - (x^2 - x - 2).$$","$x^2 - 2x + 3$","$x^2 - 4x - 1$","$x^2 + 2x - 1$","$3x^2 - 2x + 3$","A","Compute term-wise: $2x^2-3x+1 - x^2 + x + 2 = x^2 - 2x + 3$."
"Q4. Evaluate $$\sum_{k=1}^{10} k.$$,","$45$","$55$","$60$","$65$","B","Use $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ with $n=10$: $\frac{10\cdot 11}{2} = 55$."
"Q5. Compute $$\frac{d}{dx} x^3.$$","$3x^2$","$x^2$","$x^3$","$6x$","A","Power rule: $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$ gives $3x^2$."
"Q6. Solve for $x$: $$2^{x} = 8.$$","$x=2$","$x=3$","$x=4$","$x=1$","B","Since $8=2^3$, we have $x=3$."
"Q7. What is the value of $$\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta?$$","$0$","$1$","$2$","$\cos 2\theta$","B","Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$."
"Q8. Find $\det\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\ 3 & 4\end{pmatrix}.$","$-2$","$2$","$-1$","$1$","A","Compute $1\cdot 4 - 2\cdot 3 = -2$."
"Q9. Evaluate $$\log_{2}(16).$$","$2$","$3$","$4$","$5$","C","Because $2^4 = 16$, so $\log_2 16 = 4$."
"Q10. A fair coin is tossed once. What is $P(\text{Head})$?","$0$","$\tfrac{1}{2}$","$\tfrac{1}{3}$","$1$","B","For a fair coin, $P(\text{Head}) = \frac{1}{2}$."
